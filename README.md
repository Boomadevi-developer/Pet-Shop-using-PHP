### Prerequisites

   ```

2. **Set Up Database**

   - Open `phpMyAdmin` (usually available at `http://localhost/phpmyadmin`).
   - Create a new database:
     ```sql
     CREATE DATABASE petshop_db;
     ```
   - Import the SQL file located in the `database` folder (i.e., `petshop_db.sql`):
     - In phpMyAdmin, go to the database you created, then click on **Import** and upload the `petshop_db.sql` file.
  
3. **Configure the Project**

   - Open the project folder and locate the configuration file `config.php` (or `.env` if you're using one).
   - Update the database connection settings as per your MySQL credentials:
     ```php
     // config.php example
     $dbHost = 'localhost';
     $dbUser = 'root';
     $dbPass = '';
     $dbName = 'petshop_db';
     ```

4. **Start Apache and MySQL**

   - Open XAMPP/WAMP and start **Apache** and **MySQL** services.
   - Visit the application at `http://localhost/pet-shop` (or wherever your project is hosted locally).
